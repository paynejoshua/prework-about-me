      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi there! Welcome to my first website that I created using somthing other than wix or squarespace. I am very excited to be learning how to code and become a website developer. This will be an arduous journey but will be so worth it in the end</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from all over. Meaning I was born in the Philippines, lived in Bolivia, South America for 4 years, spent the latter part of elementary through high school years in Grand Rapids, MI, moved to California for about 4 years, and then finally ended up in Kirkland, Washington. 

      </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I really like to play music and record said music. I am a Pastor at heart and love to study for sermons.
       I enjoy reading detailed science-science fiction (I.E The Martian by Andy Weir). I also enjoy spending time with
       my beautiful wife
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Anything that will allow me to work remotely. Hence me embarking on this 6 month journey</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Kirkland, Washington.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Ever since I was a teenager I have been interested in learning how to code. My brother and and I would 
        participate in LAN parties and I was always fascinated by the design of the games. Ever since then I have been
        interested in learning how to code in order to implement my own ideas in a digital format.
